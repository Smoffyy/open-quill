# open-quill UI presets

open-quill ships two complete first-party skins, switchable per workspace by an admin. This document is the map for anyone or assistant touching theming.

## The one-attribute architecture

Everything hangs off a single attribute on `<html>`:

```
data-preset="anthropic" | "openai"
```

plus the ordinary theme attribute:

```
data-theme="light" | "anthropic" | "openai"   (oled is a legacy alias of the openai palette)
```

Rules:

1. **The Anthropic preset is the default codebase.** It must never require preset-specific CSS. If you write a rule for it, write it plain.
2. **Every OpenAI-preset rule lives in `client/src/styles/openai.css`** and is scoped `[data-preset="openai"]` (or `:root[data-theme="openai"]` / `:root[data-preset="openai"][data-theme="light"]` for palette tokens). Nothing OpenAI-flavored may leak into other stylesheets.
3. `openai.css` is imported **last** in `client/src/styles/app.css`, so equal-specificity ties go to the preset sheet by design. Don't reorder imports.
4. **Components are never forked.** Behavioral differences branch inline on `cfg.uiPreset === 'openai'` (React) or `document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-preset') === 'openai'` (non-React code paths). Keep the branch list short and auditable — it is enumerated below.

## Where the preset comes from

- Server setting `ui_preset` (SQLite key-value via `getSetting`/`setSetting` in `server/index.js`).
- Exposed in `GET /api/app-config` as `uiPreset` and `uiPresetChosen`.
- Changed via `PATCH /api/admin/app-config { uiPreset }` → also flips the default `app_font` (sans for openai, serif for anthropic) unless the same request sets a font, writes an audit log entry, and calls `broadcastConfig()` so every connected client re-themes live.
- First-run: when `uiPresetChosen === false`, admins see the chooser modal (`.preset-scrim` / `.preset-modal` in `App.jsx` + `modals.css`). Admins can change it later in Admin → Branding → Interface preset (`AdminPanel.jsx`).
- Pre-React boot: `client/index.html` reads `localStorage 'oq-preset'` and `'oq-theme'` and sets both attributes before paint (no flash). `applyCfg`/`applyPrefs` keep localStorage in sync afterwards.

## Theme mapping (prefs.js → applyPrefs)

- User theme prefs are only `system | light | dark` (stored `oled` reads as `dark`).
- Under preset `anthropic`: dark → `data-theme="anthropic"`.
- Under preset `openai`: dark → `data-theme="openai"` (the pitch-black palette).
- Cursor: while the preset is `openai`, the streaming cursor is **forced** circle+on for everyone; any other preset reverts to the user's stored cursor prefs (computed at apply time, never written to their prefs).

## The complete JS branch list (`cfg.uiPreset === 'openai'` or data-preset reads)

- `App.jsx` — chat topbar ModelDropdown; home-screen `.home-topbar` ModelDropdown; `hideModelPicker` for the composer; persistent per-message assistant icons (`showIcon`); floating chat composer wrapper class + 808px max width; incognito hero renders "Temporary Chat" + note; instant streaming (reveal loop `instant` flag); `QuickPrompts` keeps layout space when hidden (`qp-ghost`).
- `prefs.js` — theme mapping and forced circle cursor described above.
- `SettingsModal.jsx` — preset-aware cursor defaults when seeding the prefs object.
- `Composer.jsx` — none. The `.ml` multiline class is preset-agnostic; only `openai.css` styles it.
- `server/index.js` — new-model defaults while `ui_preset === 'openai'`: `icon_size 28`, `show_name 1`, `icon_position 'left'`, `generating_anim/thinking_anim 'none'`, `dropdown_icon 0`.

## Layout invariants worth knowing before editing

- The OpenAI composer is a 52px pill: constant side padding (48px left / 96px right) in **both** single-line and `.ml` states; `.ml` only adds `padding-bottom: 52px`. Keeping the horizontal padding identical between states is what prevents wrap-point feedback loops (typing jitter). Don't reintroduce state-dependent horizontal padding.
- `.composer-bar` is absolutely pinned inside the pill (`z-index: 6`); the composer itself is `z-index: 3`, plus-menu `80 !important`, quick prompts `1`, floating chat wrapper `30`.
- The chat composer floats (`.composer-wrap.floating`) over the scroll area with a to-top gradient; `thread-pad` reserves 130px so content never hides beneath it.
- Widths: thread and composer wrapper are 808px containers with 20px side padding → 768px content, matching measured chatgpt.com.
- Measured palette (from screenshots at 1×): dark `#000` app/sidebar, `#212121` composer, `#2b2b2b` bubble, `#303030` menus, `#424242` menu hover, `#1a1a1a` active rows; light `#fcfcfc` app/sidebar, `#fff` composer with `#0000001f` border, `#e9e9e9` bubble, `#e2e2e2` active rows, black accent.
- Markdown math accepts `$…$`, `$$…$$`, and normalizes `\(…\)` / `\[…\]` (outside code) in `Markdown.jsx:normalizeMathDelims`; streaming holds unclosed math via `autoCloseMath`.

## Adding a feature checklist

1. Build it plain (Anthropic look) first.
2. If the OpenAI skin needs different visuals, add scoped rules to `openai.css` only.
3. If it needs different *behavior*, branch on `cfg.uiPreset` and add the branch to the list above.
4. Verify both presets and both light/dark before shipping. Preset switching is live — test by toggling in Admin → Branding with a second window open.
