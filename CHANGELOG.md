## [2026.2.2] — 2026-06-11

### Changed
- Updated **ALL** dependencies to the **Latest** version.

### Fixed
- Fix `.reasoning-body` margin.
- Tools only execute after a step's stream completes. If you stop mid-step, the loop breaks before executing.
- My "pending files" feature shows files in the tree from the streamed text before they're committed. Clicking one fetches from the server, which 404s.
- Pass committed to the Viewer so a pending (not-yet-written) file shows a placeholder and auto-loads once real, instead of erroring.
